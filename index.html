      <p>There have been <span style="color: can;">2775 hate crimes</span> in New York between 2019 and 2023. This website focuses on the <span style="color: can;">hate crimes</span> that took place during 2020. A time when even though people where supposed to stay at home, <span style="color: can;"> crimes</span> still happened.<span style="color: black;">A</span></p>
      <p id="what"><span style="color: black;">l</span>"A <span style="color: can;">hate crime</span>   is a crime that is motivated
        in whole or substantial part by <span style="color: can;">bias against
        certain personal characteristics</span>. According
        to New York State law, there must be an
        underlying crime in order for an incident to
        be classified as a <span style="color: can;">hate crime</span>. That means
        authorities must first determine there was a
        crime committed. If it’s determined that the
        crime was motivated by bias, then <span style="color: can;"></span>hate crime
        charges may be added to the original charge.<span style="color: black;">A</span></p>
        <p id="why">These enhanced penalties exist because
        while any crime has a negative impact on
        the victim, <span style="color: can;">hate crimes impact victims on
        a much deeper and emotional level</span>, and
        the impact is wider<span style="color: can;">—creating fear and
        community unrest with those who share
        the victim’s characteristics</span>. There are
        many types of underlying crimes that,
        when combined with biased intent, can
        be considered hate crimes, including
        <span style="color: can;">physical assault, verbal threats, robberies
        and burglaries, and property damage
        such as graffiti</span>.<span style="color: black;">A</span></p>
        <p>
        New York law also specifically provides that
        anyone who places a <span style="color: can;">swastika or noose—both</span>
        historical expressions of hate—with the intent
        to harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm, can also
        be <span style="color:can;">charged with aggravated harassment"</span> - NYC
